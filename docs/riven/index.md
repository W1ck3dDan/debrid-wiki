(*[ElfHosted Discord](https://discord.elfhosted.com)*)

## Deployment

### Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following contents:

```yml
version: "3.8"

services:
    riven:
        image: rivenmedia/riven:latest
        container_name: riven
        restart: unless-stopped
        environment:
            PUID: "1000"
            PGID: "1000"
            ORIGIN: "http://localhost:3000" # read below for more info
        ports:
            - "3000:3000"
        volumes:
            - ./data:/riven/data
            - /mnt:/mnt
```

Then run `docker compose up -d` to start the container in the background. You can then access the web interface at `http://localhost:3000` or whatever port and origin you set in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

#### What is ORIGIN ?

`ORIGIN` is the URL of the frontend on which you will access it from anywhere. If you are hosting Riven on a vps with IP address `134.32.24.44` then you will need to set the `ORIGIN` to `http://134.32.24.44:3000` (no trailing slash). Similarly, if using a domain name, you will need to set the `ORIGIN` to `http://riven.mydomain.com:3000` (no trailing slash). If you change the port in the `docker-compose.yml` file, you will need to change it in the `ORIGIN` as well.

### Running outside of Docker

To run outside of docker you will need to have node (v18.13+) and python (3.10+) installed. Then clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rivenmedia/riven.git
```

and open two terminals in the root of the project and run the following commands in each.

#### First terminal:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 node build
```

Read above for more info on `ORIGIN`.

#### Second terminal:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python backend/main.py
```

This configuration file allows for extensive customization of the behavior of Riven, including integration with various services and control over downloading and scraping operations. Each section and its options can be tailored to meet specific needs or preferences.

<!-- ### Symlinking settings

<h1 style="color: red">IS THIS SECTION STILL NEEDED? OR SHOULD THIS BE EXPLAINED ABOVE?</h1>

"host_mount" should point to your rclone mount that has your torrents on your host, if you are using native webdav set webdav-url to "https://dav.real-debrid.com/torrents"

"container_mount" should point to the location of the mount in plex container

#### Example:

Rclone is mounted to /riven/vfs on your host machine -> settings should have: "host_mount": "/riven/vfs"

Plex container volume configuration for rclone mount is "/riven/vfs:/media/vfs" -> settings should have: "container_mount": "/media/vfs"

Plex libraries you want to add to sections: movies -> /media/library/movies, shows -> /media/library/shows

## Development

![Flowchart](../public/riven/flowchart.png)

You can view the readme in `make` to get started!

```sh
make
```

To get started you can simply do this. This will stop any previous Riven containers and remove previous image.
As well as rebuild the image using cached layers. If your a developer, then any files changed in the code will not get cached,
and thus rebuilt in the image.

```sh
make start
```

You can also restart the container with `make restart`, or view the logs with `make logs`.

### Development without `make`

If you don't want to use `make` and docker, you can use the following commands to run development environment.

```sh
pip install poetry
poetry install
poetry run python backend/main.py
```

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

We use Black for backend and Prettier for frontend. Please make sure to run the formatters before submitting a pull request. Also use CRLF line endings unless it is a shell script or something that requires LF line endings.

We've switched to Poetry!

Poetry simplifies dependency management by automatically handling package versions and resolving conflicts, ensuring that every contributor works with a consistent set of dependencies. To contribute to this project using Poetry, you'll need to install Poetry on your system. This can be done by `pip install poetry`. Once installed, you can easily manage the project's dependencies.

For starters, after cloning the repository, run `poetry install` in the project's root directory. This command installs all the necessary dependencies as defined in the `pyproject.toml` file, creating an isolated virtual environment for the project. Contributors can then activate the virtual environment using `poetry shell` or run project-related commands directly using `poetry run`. 

Poetry also simplifies the process of adding new dependencies or updating existing ones with commands like `poetry add package-name` and `poetry update package-name`, respectively. Before submitting a pull request, ensure your changes are compatible with the project's dependencies and coding standards. To facilitate this, we encourage contributors to use `poetry run command` to run tests and linters.
