# Debrid Services

This section contains information about what debrid services are, various debrid services, their features, and how to use them.

## What are Debrid Services?

These are generally paid services (with some giving free trials) where you can enter a premium link or torrent link to it and it will generate a direct download link for you. This is useful for people who want to download files from file hosting websites and torrent websites without having to wait for the file to be downloaded. It is not limited to just video files, it can be any file type.

You can also view videos directly through your browser (also works with torrent files that have video)

### How does torrenting work on a Debrid service?

Debrid services downloads torrent on their servers first, then gives you a direct link to download from them. Thus, you do not need to set up or install a torrent client. Just having a browser is needed to download. Think of it like you're renting a torrent client on someone else's computer.

Usually, when you input a torrent on a Debrid site, you need to wait for it to download on their end first, then you can download it directly. It depends on the number of seeders available.

For some Debrid services such as [Real-Debrid](https://real-debrid.com/), there are also some instances where if the torrent is popular enough and other Real-Debrid users already downloaded it, it will be instantly available for you to download as well, no need to wait for the Debrid service to download it first. This is known as Cached Torrents.

### When downloading torrents, why use this instead of a [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network)?

-   It's (usually) cheaper compared to most VPNs
-   You don't need to install anything. Just paste the links on the service and it will generate a download link for you
-   It is accessible to any device with a web browser
-   You don't need to worry about the following:
    -   IP address leaking
    -   Checking if ISP is torrent-friendly
    -   Configuring torrent clients
    -   Setting up kill switches
    -   Setting up the network to allow torrent downloading
    -   Threatening letters from big corporations

### What is the difference between this and a [Seedbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seedbox)?

<div class="annotate" markdown>

-   A Debrid service has support for multiple premium file hosts, while a Seedbox does not
-   A Debrid service, once it completes a torrent download, will stop seeding, while a Seedbox seeds a download forever until you stop it from seeding (hence the name). This may discourage torrenting, as what the Debrid service is doing is a hit and run (1) , so please keep it in mind
-   A Debrid service is usually cheaper than a Seedbox

1.  Some Debrid services, such as Premiumize, [can seed for a certain amount of time](https://www.premiumize.me/features/torrent).

### I'm interested! How can I start using a Debrid service?

First, you need to choose and research the best Debrid services for you. There are many Debrid services available, with varying features, some examples below:

-   [Real-Debrid](real-debrid.md)
-   [Premiumize](premiumize.md)
-   [AllDebrid](alldebrid.md)

Payment methods include (but not limited to) [credit/debit cards, Amazon pay, Cryto](https://i.imgur.com/dERMQ22.png), etc. You can also [buy from a reseller](https://imgur.com/LlnVRDm).

After choosing a Debrid service, you need to sign up for an account and pay for a subscription. Some Debrid services offer free trials, so you can try them out before committing to a subscription. Once you have an account, you can immediately start using the service.

Generally, 1 debrid service is enough for most people. However, some people use multiple debrid services to get the best of both worlds or to have a backup in case one of the debrid services goes down.
