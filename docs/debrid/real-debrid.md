Real-Debrid is an unrestricted downloader that allows you to quickly download files hosted on the Internet or instantly stream them into an innovative web player. It is a paid service that offers premium features to its users. It is a popular debrid service that supports a large number of file hosts and torrents. It is also known for its fast and reliable service.

## Features

Real-Debrid's [premium features](https://real-debrid.com/premium) page mentions all the features that are available to its users with the pricing.

They also have fidelity points system, where once you accumulate 1000 points, you can convert them to 30 days of premium subscription or convert them to a voucher. You can earn these points by doing various activities like referring friends, buying a subscription, etc.

The subscription can be [redeemed from the accounts page](https://real-debrid.com/account) and converted to [a voucher from affiliate page](https://real-debrid.com/affiliate).

## Limitations

There are some limitations to the service, such as:

-   Limited to 1 IP address per account at a time. This means you can't use it on multiple devices at the same time unless they are on the same network or using media servers like Plex self hosted on server.
-   The maximum torrent size is 2TB (pretty big, but still a limitation).
-   Some hosters like [ddownload](https://ddownload.com) and [scribd](https://scribd.com) have daily limits.

## Remote Traffic

Real-Debrid also has a feature called Remote Traffic. Remote Traffic is traffic you can use to share directly with friends (who doesn't have a RD account), or to remote upload between different filehosts.

Say you find something you really want, and your friend wants it too, but it's only available as premium, and your friend has neither premium nor debrid.Sure you could download it normally with your RD account, and then use your own connection to upload it somewhere else for your friend afterwards.However you could also just paste the link, and convert it to a remote link, which can then be downloaded directly by your friend at full speed from RD's servers, while deducting the download size off your accounts remote traffic.

Or you can use the same link, enter it in your filehoster of choice's upload page, and have it uploaded almost instantly to that host. (or multiple hosts if you like).For information: You can always buy extra remote upload, at great prices.

You can buy remote traffic from the [additional traffic page](https://real-debrid.com/trafficshare).

## Using Real-Debrid

Real-Debrid has a web player that allows you to stream videos directly from the service but you can also integrate it with various media servers like Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, etc. to stream videos directly from your media server or use it with Stremio, Kodi, etc. to stream videos directly to your device.

You can also use it with download managers like JDownloader, Internet Download Manager, etc. to download files directly to your computer.

There are many projects that integrate with Real-Debrid, some require self-hosting :money_with_wings: and some don't.
