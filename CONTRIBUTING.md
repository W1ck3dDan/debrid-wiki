## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Debrid Wiki Code of Conduct](https://github.com/debrid/debrid-wikiblob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to `admin@debrid.wiki`

## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/debrid/debrid-wiki/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/debrid/debrid-wiki/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

## I Want To Contribute

You can fork the repository and start adding `.md` files in `docs` folder, whichever sub-folder applicable. It is recommended that you read the official documentation of VitePress to understand some of the routing and markdown features.

After you are done, send a pull reequest! It is recommended you make a new branch instead of `main`.

### Reporting Bugs

Search the issues if the bug has already been reported. If not, you can make a issue and provide as much context as possible

## Styleguides

Just make sure you are using prettier to format the markdown / code files (tab width 4) before committing.

### Commit Messages

Try to follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) as much as possible and you are good to go!

## Join The Project Team

You will be invited automatically to be a core contributor if you help a lot in the development or have a history of writing amazing documentations :)
